        <ol>
            <li>Liuhe Night Market</li>
            <li>Ximending Night Market</li>
            <li>Raohe Night Market</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Liuhe Night Market</h1>
        <p><strong>Experiences</strong></p>
        <p>We were given an hour to roam around Liuhe night market and get food. I didn't eat much though.</p>

        <p><strong>Interesting Sights</strong></p>
        <p>The streets are pretty narrow and there isn't much to see, in my opinion. But the different variants of food were interesting, and the way the street was layed out safely.</p>

        <p><strong>Personal Experiences</strong></p>
        <p>I didn't have much experience so I was panicking and in general, the situation felt really hectic.</p>

        <h1>Ximending Night Market</h1>
        <p><strong>Experiences</strong></p>
        <p>We got to roam around yet again, but since it's bigger we'd have to use GPS in order not to get lost.</p>

        <p><strong>Interesting Sights</strong></p>
        <p>There were a lot of branded shops but they're a little bit cheaper compared to the stuff you'd see in Indonesia even though it isn't a HUGE difference.
            PLUS, second hand stores are available here and there and they have really good finds!
        </p>

        <p><strong>Personal Experiences</strong></p>
        <p>Again, it was hectic. But it felt a little more fulfilling-- Me and my friend just got lost over a couple of turns since we wanted to go look for clothing and stuff but it turned out to be pretty far and we did NOT have that much time left.</p>

        <h1>Raohe Night Market</h1>
        <p><strong>Experiences</strong></p>
        <p>We got to wander but since Raohe night market stretches out pretty long we're warned not to go until the end!</p>

        <p><strong>Interesting Sights</strong></p>
        <p>It's narrow and crowded but somehow it doesn't feel as hectic as Ximending. It's beautiful and casual, more slow-paced, that's for sure.</p>

        <p><strong>Personal Experiences</strong></p>
        <p>I managed to get a good amount of food until I was full despite being on a low budget, the stuff there are relatively cheap. I also got a couple of trinkets.</p>
